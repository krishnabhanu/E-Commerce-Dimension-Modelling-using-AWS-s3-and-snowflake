I have experience working with E-commerce data from Kaggle. The dataset includes both product information and order history. To process this data, I transformed relational databases into a Star schema using AWS S3 and Snowflake tools.

Initially, I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and uploaded it to an Amazon S3 bucket. I then created credentials for the bucket to access the data from S3 and loaded it into Snowflake. The code for this can be found in Connection_from_AWS-SNOWFLAKE.sql. After that, I designed facts and dimensions, The code for this can be found in Creating_Star_Schema.sql and analyzed data on the star schema, The code for this can be found in Analysis on Star Schema Data.sql.

Here is the URL where you can find the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data.
